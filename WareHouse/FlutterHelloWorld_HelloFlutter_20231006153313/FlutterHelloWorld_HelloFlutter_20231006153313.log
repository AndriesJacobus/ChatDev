According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Leverage Flutter to create a HelloWork mobile app".

Modality: "mobile app".

Programming Language: " Flutter"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Flutter. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

main.dart

import 'package:hello_work_app/home_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(HelloWorkApp());
}

class HelloWorkApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HelloWork',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

home_screen.dart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('HelloWork'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Hello, World!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this implementation, we have two files: main.dart and home_screen.dart.

The main.dart file is the entry point of the application. It imports the material.dart package from the Flutter framework and the home_screen.dart file. The main function runs the HelloWorkApp widget, which is a MaterialApp widget that sets the title and theme of the app and sets the home screen to the HomeScreen widget.

The home_screen.dart file defines the HomeScreen widget, which is a StatelessWidget. It builds a Scaffold widget with an AppBar and a body containing a Center widget with a Text widget displaying "Hello, World!".

This code creates a basic HelloWork mobile app using Flutter.

<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the guidelines mentioned. However, there is one potential improvement that can be made to enhance the user experience.

In the `HomeScreen` widget, the text "Hello, World!" is hardcoded. It would be more user-friendly if we allow the user to customize this greeting message. To achieve this, we can modify the `HomeScreen` widget to accept a parameter for the greeting message and update the text accordingly.

Here's how you can make the necessary changes:

1. In `home_screen.dart`, modify the `HomeScreen` class to accept a `String` parameter for the greeting message:

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final String greeting;

  HomeScreen({this.greeting});

  // Rest of the code...
}
```

2. Update the `Text` widget in the `body` section of `HomeScreen` to use the `greeting` parameter:

```dart
body: Center(
  child: Text(
    greeting,
    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
  ),
),
```

3. In `main.dart`, update the `HomeScreen` instantiation to pass the desired greeting message:

```dart
home: HomeScreen(greeting: 'Hello, World!'),
```

By making these changes, the app will allow the user to customize the greeting message displayed on the home screen. You can modify the greeting message as per your requirements.

Once you've made these modifications, the code will be ready for use.

<COMMENT>
In the `main.dart` file, the `HelloWorkApp` class is missing the implementation of the `build` method. To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `build` method in the `HelloWorkApp` class.

Here's the revised code for `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hello_work_app/home_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(HelloWorkApp());
}

class HelloWorkApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HelloWork',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(greeting: 'Hello, World!'), // Updated to pass greeting message
    );
  }
}
```

<INFO> Please make the necessary changes to the `main.dart` file by adding the implementation of the `build` method in the `HelloWorkApp` class.

<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the guidelines mentioned. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `main.dart` file, the import statement for the `home_screen.dart` file is missing. This will result in a compilation error as the `HomeScreen` class cannot be found. To fix this, you need to add the import statement for `home_screen.dart` at the beginning of the `main.dart` file.

Here's the revised code for `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hello_work_app/home_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(HelloWorkApp());
}

class HelloWorkApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HelloWork',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(greeting: 'Hello, World!'),
    );
  }
}
```

Once you make this change, the code should compile and run successfully.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the guidelines mentioned. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `main.dart` file, the import statement for the `home_screen.dart` file is missing. This will result in a compilation error as the `HomeScreen` class cannot be found. To fix this, you need to add the import statement for `home_screen.dart` at the beginning of the `main.dart` file.

Here's the revised code for `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hello_work_app/home_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(HelloWorkApp());
}

class HelloWorkApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HelloWork',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(greeting: 'Hello, World!'),
    );
  }
}
```

Once you make this change, the code should compile and run successfully."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Since the provided codes are written in Dart using the Flutter framework, we don't need a requirements.txt file as we would in a Python project. Instead, we need to specify the dependencies in the pubspec.yaml file.

The pubspec.yaml file is used in Flutter projects to manage dependencies and other project configurations. It is similar to the requirements.txt file in Python.

To specify the dependencies for the HelloWork mobile app, you can update the pubspec.yaml file as follows:

pubspec.yaml
```
name: hello_work_app
description: A HelloWork mobile app built with Flutter.

environment:
  sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0"

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true

```

In the above example, we have added the `cupertino_icons` package as a dependency. You can add more dependencies as needed for your HelloWork mobile app.

Remember to run `flutter pub get` in the terminal to fetch the dependencies specified in the pubspec.yaml file before running the app.

Note: Make sure to update the pubspec.yaml file according to the actual dependencies required by your HelloWork mobile app. The provided example includes the basic dependencies needed for a Flutter app.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Since the provided codes are written in Dart using the Flutter framework, we don't need a requirements.txt file as we would in a Python project. Instead, we need to specify the dependencies in the pubspec.yaml file.
The pubspec.yaml file is used in Flutter projects to manage dependencies and other project configurations. It is similar to the requirements.txt file in Python.
To specify the dependencies for the HelloWork mobile app, you can update the pubspec.yaml file as follows:
pubspec.yaml
```
name: hello_work_app
description: A HelloWork mobile app built with Flutter.
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
```
In the above example, we have added the `cupertino_icons` package as a dependency. You can add more dependencies as needed for your HelloWork mobile app.
Remember to run `flutter pub get` in the terminal to fetch the dependencies specified in the pubspec.yaml file before running the app.
Note: Make sure to update the pubspec.yaml file according to the actual dependencies required by your HelloWork mobile app. The provided example includes the basic dependencies needed for a Flutter app. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
